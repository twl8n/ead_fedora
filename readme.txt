Introduction
------------

This project is a small Ruby utility (Module, Class, API) that reads a
standard EAD finding aid, and creates Fedora objects for he collection
and all c0x container elements. Enhancements will include creating
objects for the digital files. This will happen via an external
utility if such a utility can be found. 



How to run
----------

Install hydra-jetty, and start the server.

Run the ruby script "run.rb".
