$CATALINA_HOME is /usr/share/tomcat6

Linux tomcat userid is tomcat

Linux login userid is mst3k

Linux user mst3k has the root password and can "su -l root". It would be
sufficient if mst3k were able to "sudo su -l root"

The Linux host is "zeus", although "localhost" is used for many
instances where a hostname is required.

Java is pre-installed, almost certainly via yum (the Fedora Linux
package manager).

MySQL is pre-installed, almost certainly via yum.

This documentation has been tested with Fedora Linux 12.

"emacs -nw somefile.txt" means to edit "somefile.txt" with your
favorite editor. Some files will be edited by mst3k, some by root.

[mst3k@zeus ~]$  uname -a
Linux zeus.lib.virginia.edu 2.6.32.26-175.fc12.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Dec 1 21:39:34 UTC 2010 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Install Tomcat6 via yum
-----------------------

su -l root
yum -y install tomcat6 tomcat6-webapps.noarch tomcat6-admin-webapps.noarch
/etc/init.d/tomcat6/start
wget -S http://localhost:8080/
cp /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf.safe

# Edit the tomcat config file:

emacs -nw /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf

# Insert this line:

JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:MaxPermSize=128M -verbose:gc"

# Edit the tomcat-users config file:

emacs -nw /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml

# Insert these lines:

  <role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="foobarbaz" roles="tomcat,manager"/>

# Restart. Now you should be able to use the "Status" and "Tomcat
# Manager" links on the Tomcat home page.

/etc/init.d/tomcat6/restart

# Environment variables CATALINA_BASE, CATALINA_HOME, JASPER_HOME,
# CATALINA_TMPDIR, JAVA_OPTS are in:

/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf




MySQL notes
-----------

First I prepared my chosen database (mysql), as per the instructions
on the Fedora Commons installation page:

https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Installation+and+Configuration

I worked as root and prepared no environment variables, as those are
primarily for client scripts, not the installer.

My one change from the standard procedure was to call my database
'fedora35' not 'fedora3', this meant I had to (slightly) alter a JDBC
parameter during the install script (see below).

Interpreting the MySQL grant statement:

grant all on fedora35.* to fedoraAdmin@localhost identified by 'fedoraAdmin';

fedora35.* = the database name is 'fedora35

fedoraAdmin@localhost = the database user is 'fedoraAdmin'

identified by 'fedoraAdmin' = the database password is 'fedoraAdmin'





MySQL session transcript
------------------------

The commands below assume you have installed MySQL, and already set your
database superuser (root) password.

[mst3k@zeus ~]$ mysql -u root -p 
Enter password:

Download the Fedora Commons installer
-------------------------------------

What I should have done:

cd ~/
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/fcrepo-installer-3.5.jar
# Continue with "Running The Fedora Commons installer" below.

What I actually did:

cd /usr/local/projects
mkdir fedora
cd fedora
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/fcrepo-installer-3.5.jar
# Continue with "Running The Fedora Commons installer" below.

The installer wants to create the Fedora home directory, but I
confused it by saying I wanted Fedora installed into an existing
directory. It worked fine, but the "should have done" procedure is
simpler. As far as I can tell, both methods require chown'ing the
fedora home directory tree after running the installer script. 

Fedora Commons downloads:

https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Downloads

Fedora Commons installer download:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fedora-commons/fcrepo-installer-3.5.jar




Running The Fedora Commons installer
------------------------------------

# As root, I ran the installer jar, chown'd the fedore home directory,
# and finally restart tomcat.

su -l root
cd /usr/local/projects/fedora
java -jar fcrepo-installer-3.5.jar
cd /usr/local/projects
chown -R tomcat:tomcat ./fedora/
/etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart      
exit

# After this, Fedora should be available at:

http://localhost:8080/fedora/describe

# Here are all the settings that were not default:

Installation type = custom
Fedora home directory = /usr/local/projects/fedora

The installer gave these warnings:
WARNING: /usr/local/projects/fedora is not empty.
WARNING: Overwrite? (yes or no) [default is no] ==> yes
WARNING: The environment variable, FEDORA_HOME, is not defined
WARNING: Remember to define the FEDORA_HOME environment variable
WARNING: before starting Fedora.

Fedora administrator password = fedoraAdmin
SSL required for API-M = false
Servlet engine = existingTomcat
Tomcat home directory = /usr/share/tomcat6

The installer gave these warnings:
WARNING: The environment variable, CATALINA_HOME, is not defined
WARNING: Remember to define the CATALINA_HOME environment variable
WARNING: before starting Fedora.
Keystore file = default

Database = mysql
Database username = fedoraAdmin
Database password = fedoraAdmin
JDBC URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost/fedora35?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp;autoReconnect=true
Policy enforcement enabled = false
Enable Resource Index = true




500 Error from Fedora
---------------------

If you get a 500 error in your web browser, instead of the Fedora
page, check ownership of the fedora home driectory tree.

If you have errors, check the catalina logs:

/usr/share/tomcat6/logs/catalina.out

aka

$CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out

(See the section "How to determine your $CATALINA_HOME".)




How to determine your $CATALINA_HOME
------------------------------------

Now that you can see the Tomcat home page, you still have a few more
steps. The home page give paths that include $CATALINA_HOME, however
this environment variable is not defined for user "root" or user
"tomcat". The environment variables magically spring into being from
the startup scripts. Thankfully, there are some easy ways to determine
the catalina home directory, and where the config files exists. We
will need to edit those config files.

# Method 1, when Tomcat is running:

ps aux | grep tomcat | grep -Po "catalina\.home=.*?\s+"

# Method 2:

locate tomcat6.conf
grep CATALINA_HOME /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf

# Below is a session transcript:

[root@zeus ~]# ps aux | grep tomcat | grep -Po "catalina\.home=.*?\s+"
catalina.home=/usr/share/tomcat6 
[root@zeus ~]# locate tomcat6.conf
/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf
[root@zeus ~]# grep CATALINA_HOME /etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf 
CATALINA_HOME="/usr/share/tomcat6"
[root@zeus ~]#




Managing Fedora From Remote Servers
-----------------------------------

Out of the box, fedora comes with a configuration to permit management
operations ONLY FROM LOCALHOST.  I change this by adding the IP of my
remote machine(s) to the Backend Security file, "beSecurity.xml",
which is in server/config/.  Adding additional IPs to the 'iplist'
attribute, with whitespace as a separator, allows low-level calls to
be authorized from non-localhost IPs.  I doubt this is a best
practice, but it gets the job done.

After tomcat starts up, I like to monitor things from two log files
and the web interface.  I use
migration.lib.virginia.edu:8080/manager/html (auth required, visible
in /usr/share/tomcat6/conf/tomcat-users.xml) and these logs:

File catalina.out reports overall Tomcat behavior, and lots of fedora
log messages end up here:

/var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out

The main Fedora servlet log:

/usr/local/fedora-home/server/logs/fedora.log 

I also use http://migration.lib.virginia.edu:8080/fedora/search as a
quick interface to look for objects and ensure the servlet is running
and accessible.

The servlet code running in Tomcat lives in
/usr/share/tomcat6/webapps/fedora, the server data, configs, logs,
etc., reside in /usr/local/fedora-home/server

Client scripts are available in /usr/local/fedora-home/client and are documented here:

https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Client+Command-line+Utilities

The installer leaves behind a useful 'properties' file (in
fedora-home/install, which can be used at a later date to configure an
installation.  Just call the jar file with the name of the properties
file as an argument.  Mine looks like this, and can be used to
re-create my configuration:

#Install Options

messaging.enabled=false

fedora.home=/usr/local/fedora-home
install.type=custom
servlet.engine=existingTomcat
apim.ssl.required=false
fedora.admin.pass=fedoraAdmin
apia.ssl.required=false

Note: check your tomcat6 installation to make sure it's running on a
good java (Sun HotSpot VM preferred) and has a keystore in an
accessible place.  Also ensure your iptables permit tcp/ip over ports
8080 and 8443.

Install Tomcat6 manually
------------------------

http://www.puschitz.com/InstallingTomcat.html





Tomcat Catalina blank web page error
------------------------------------

The quick answer is that you should have run this command originally:

yum -y install tomcat6 tomcat6-webapps.noarch tomcat6-admin-webapps.noarch


What really happened was that you installed tomcat6 via yum (or apt),
probably with a command such as:

yum -y install tomcat6

When you start the tomcat server and visit localhost:8080 or
yourhostname.com:8080 but you get a blank page. You can also use wget
to discover that there is a server error.

Assuming that you don't have other permissions or system admin issue,
the problem is that you needed to install two more packages as shown
above: tomcat6-webapps.noarch tomcat6-admin-webapps.noarch

In web browser get a blank page. You can't find any errors in log
files. Below is the error from wget if tomcat6-webapps and
tomcat6-admin-webapps are not installed.

[root@zeus ~]# wget -S http://localhost:8080/

The "truststore" parameters are leftover from an old attempt to get
fedora3 running over SSL, but may be significant here.  The truststore
mentioned exists and is readable by tomcat, and that is the correct
password.
